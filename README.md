## Introduction

**Mouse Anywhere** is a Python package providing smooth and programmable mouse movements for Windows systems by leveraging a high-performance C library. Designed for automation, gaming, and demonstrations, this package offers precise and customizable cursor control.

---

## Features

- Smooth and natural movements with multiple easing types.
- **Absolute** and **Relative Targeting** for flexibility.
- Multithreaded operation to run seamlessly in the background.
- Queue-based system for sequential movements.
- Adjustable strength and easing for custom movement profiles.
- Logging support for debugging and monitoring.
- Low-level DLL access for advanced use cases.

---

## Installation

Install Mouse Anywhere from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mouse-anywhere/):

```bash
pip install mouse-anywhere
```

**Note**: Mouse Anywhere is **Windows-only** due to platform-specific dependencies.

---

## Quick Start

Below is a quick example to get you started:

```python
from mouse_anywhere import MouseMovement, EASE_SINUSOIDAL
import time

# Initialize MouseMovement
mouse = MouseMovement(easing_type=EASE_SINUSOIDAL, strength=50)

# Start the movement
mouse.start()

# Add targets
mouse.add_absolute_target(1000, 800)
mouse.add_relative_target(-50, 50)

# Allow some time for movement
time.sleep(5)

# Stop the movement
mouse.stop()
```

---

## Detailed Usage

### Initialization

```python
from mouse_anywhere import MouseMovement, EASE_LINEAR

# Create a MouseMovement instance
mouse = MouseMovement(easing_type=EASE_LINEAR, strength=75)
```

### Adding Targets

#### Absolute Target
```python
mouse.add_absolute_target(500, 300)
```

#### Relative Target
```python
mouse.add_relative_target(100, 50)
```

### Starting and Stopping Movement

```python
mouse.start()
mouse.stop()
```

---

## Easing Types

| Easing Type      | Description                             |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `EASE_LINEAR` (1) | Constant speed throughout the movement. |
| `EASE_QUADRATIC` (2) | Quadratic acceleration.               |
| `EASE_SINUSOIDAL` (3) | Smooth sinusoidal easing.            |
| `EASE_CUBIC` (4)    | Cubic acceleration.                   |
| `EASE_EXPONENTIAL` (5) | Exponential easing.                 |

## Low-Level API (DLL Integration)

Advanced users can directly interact with the underlying DLL for additional control. Below is an example:

### Python Integration

```python
from ctypes import CDLL, c_int

# Load the DLL
mouse_dll = CDLL('mouse-anywhere.dll')

# Initialize
mouse_dll.initialize()

# Absolute cursor movement
mouse_dll.set_cursor_abs(c_int(500), c_int(300))

# Shutdown
mouse_dll.mouse_shutdown()
```

### C DLL Functions

The DLL includes the following exported functions:

- `initialize()` - Initialize the DLL.
- `mouse_shutdown()` - Shut down the DLL.
- `set_cursor_abs(int x, int y)` - Move the cursor to an absolute position.
- `set_cursor_rel(int dx, int dy)` - Move the cursor relatively.
- `enqueue_target_abs(int x, int y)` - Add absolute target to the queue.
- `enqueue_target_rel(int dx, int dy)` - Add relative target to the queue.

Refer to the C source for more details.

## Logging

Mouse Anywhere logs all actions to `mouse_movement.log`:

**Sample Log:**
```
[2024-12-23 14:35:22] Movement initialized.
[2024-12-23 14:35:25] Enqueued new target: (1000, 800) [Absolute]
[2024-12-23 14:35:27] Moved to (1000, 800)
[2024-12-23 14:35:30] Stopped movement.
```
